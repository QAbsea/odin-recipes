   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This pasta salad recipe was given to me by a dear friend many years ago,
        and I've been making it ever since! It's great for barbecues.
   </p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>Pasta: This colorful, top-rated pasta salad starts with one pound of tri-colored spiral pasta.</li>
       <li>Dressing: Use a bottle of store-bought Italian-style dressing or, 
           if you want to go the extra mile, make your own at home. 
       </li>
        <li>Seasoning mix: Salad seasoning mix lends tons of savory flavor. </li>
        <li>Vegetables: You'll need cherry tomatoes, three bell peppers (green, yellow, and red), 
            and a can of black olives. 
        </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>

   <ol>
       <li>Cook and drain the pasta. </li>
       <li>Whisk the dressing with the seasoning mix. </li>
       <li>Combine the pasta with the vegetables, then toss in the seasoned dressing.</li>
   </ol>
